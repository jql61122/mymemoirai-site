        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
          MyMemoir helps users record, transcribe, and generate personal
          memoirs using artificial intelligence. The Service may include
          temporary data processing on secure servers and integrations with
          third-party technologies such as OpenAI’s API.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          MyMemoir currently does not require user accounts. Any data you submit
          or record is associated only with your device or temporary processing
          session. You are responsible for safeguarding your device and exported
          files.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Fees and Payments</h2>
        <p>
          Certain features of MyMemoir may require payment, including but not
          limited to a one-time purchase price for downloading the app or in-app
          purchases for premium features. All fees are displayed within the app
          or App Store listing and are subject to change. Payments are processed
          through Apple’s App Store or other authorized platforms and are
          subject to their terms. All sales are final except where required by
          law.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">5. User Content and License</h2>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of all content, recordings, and other materials
          you submit through MyMemoir. By submitting content, you grant MyMemoir
          a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid,
          transferable, and sublicensable license to host, store, reproduce,
          modify, adapt, translate, distribute, and otherwise use your content
          for the purposes of operating and improving the service, developing
          new features, and internal analytics or testing. You waive any moral
          rights or rights of attribution to the extent permitted by law. While
          this license is broad for legal clarity, MyMemoir does not claim
          ownership of your personal stories and will never publicly share them
          without your explicit consent.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">6. Data Handling and Storage</h2>
        <p>
          MyMemoir temporarily processes story text, recordings, and
          AI-generated drafts through secure AWS servers and OpenAI’s API to
          create your memoir. This data is not stored permanently. It may be
          retained briefly during processing and then deleted automatically or
          periodically purged. We do not sell, rent, or share your data with
          third parties.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">7. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
